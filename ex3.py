#prints initial text
print ("I will now count my chickens:")

#prints text and calculation - notice % in l6
print ("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)
print ("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)

#same as line 2 - prints text
print ("Now I will count the eggs:")

#prints calculation
print (3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 +6)

#prints text and new print calculation with <
print ("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")
print (3 + 2 < 5 - 7)

#same as l5 and l6 with print text at l21
print ("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)
print ("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)
print ("Oh, that's why it's False")

print ("How about some more?")

#print text and boolean at the end
print ("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
print ("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)
print ("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)
