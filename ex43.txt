#Exercise 43: Basic Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

#small paragraph
"Aliens have invaded a space ship and our hero has to go through a maze of rooms
 defeating them so he can escape into an escape pod to the planet below. The game
 will be more like a Zork or Adventure type game with text outputs and funny ways
 to die. The game will involve an engine that runs a map full of rooms or scenes.
 Each room will print its own description when the player enters it and then tell
 the engine what room to run next out of the map."

#scene descriptions
  - death
    - when player dies
    - funny print()
  - central corridor
    - starting porint
  - laser weapon armory
    - hero gets neutron bomb
    - keypad
      - player has to guess the number

#drawing a map
- more descriptions for each room

#extract key concepts plus research(!)
- list nouns
  - player
  - ship
  - planet
  - map
  - ...
- analyze class hierarchy
- maybe include verbs

#class hierarchy and object map
- what is similar to other things
- what is basically just another word for another thing
- "Central Corridor" basically just a scene
-   * Map
      - next_scene
      - opening_scene
    * Engine
      - play
    * Scene
      - enter
      * Death
      * Central Corridor
      * Laser Weapon Armory
      * The Bridge
      * Escape Pod

#create classes and test to run them
- placeholder classes

          class Scene(object):

              def enter(self):
                  pass


          class Engine(object):

              def __init__(self, scene_map):
                  pass

              def play(self):
                  pass

          class Death(Scene):

              def enter(self):
                  pass

          class CentralCorridor(Scene):

              def enter(self):
                  pass

          class LaserWeaponArmory(Scene):

              def enter(self):
                  pass

          class TheBridge(Scene):

              def enter(self):
                  pass

          class EscapePod(Scene):

              def enter(self):
                  pass


          class Map(object):

              def __init__(self, start_scene):
                  pass

              def next_scene(self, scene_name):
                  pass

              def opening_scene(self):
                  pass


          a_map = Map('central_corridor')
          a_game = Engine(a_map)
          a_game.play()

#top down
    1. Write or draw about the problem.
    2. Extract key concepts from 1 and research them.
    3. Create a class hierarchy and object map for the concepts.
    4. Code the classes and a test to run them.
    5. Repeat and refine.
#bottom up
    1. Take a small piece of the problem; hack on some code and get it to run barely.
    2. Refine the code into something more formal with classes and automated tests.
    3. Extract the key concepts you're using and try to find research for them.
    4. Write a description of what's really going on.
    5. Go back and refine the code, possibly throwing it out and starting over.
    6. Repeat, moving on to some other piece of the problem.
